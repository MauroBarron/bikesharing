# McDonalds Density in New York and Citibike trips.	
Analysis of New York City Citibike sharing program and density of McDonalds restaurants, presented as a Tableau story. 

### Project Summary.  

Should Des Moines, Iowa start a Citibike sharing program like New York's? That is the question this Tableau analysis and presentation explores.  Analysis of Citibike ride sharing data in relation to density of McDonald's restaurants is presented in a Tableau story that hopes to offer a piece of the puzzle in answering the bigger question of whether Citibike sharing is likely to succeed in Des Moines.



### The Story

The analysis is presented as a Tableau story with four dashboards, and  can be found here: https://public.tableau.com/profile/mauro.barron#!/vizhome/bikesharing1/McDonaldsDensityinNewYorkandCitibiketrips?publish=yes

#### Dashboard 1: What is the density of McDonalds in New York City in relation to Citibike rental stations?

- Contains summary statistics on Manhattan and Brooklyn Citibike sharing for August, 2018, as well as status on population, and density of McDonalds.
- Popular Drop Off Stations is a heat map of all stations that had over 2,500 drop offs.  The circle markers vary in size and color, which corresponds to station drop off counts.
- Manhattan and Brooklyn McDonalds.  A map showing all twenty McDonalds in Brookly and Manhattan. 



#### Dashboard 2: Where are NY Citibike riders going in relation to McDonald's restaurants.?

- Most Popular Drop off Stations: This heatmaps shows only the stations that each had over 10,000 bike drop offs.  The goal of this visual is to restrict the data to only the very most popular stations.
- Manhattan and Brooklyn McDonalds: This is the location map for McDonalds in the two boroughs. 
- The goal of this Dashboard is to display a visual pattern Manhattan and Brooklyn McDonalds, along with the very most popular drop off stations. The hope is that viewers a similar patter in both maps. 

#### Dashboard 3: What about short trips? Trips under 1 kilometer.

- Perhaps filtering the data to short trips will show if the drop off locations match McDonald's locations.  Presumably someone in Brooklyn does not need to ride to Manhattan to visit a McDonalds, so perhaps there is a relationship between short trips and density of McDonalds.
- Short Trip Start Stations: A heat map of stations where short trips started.
- Short Trip Drop Off Stations: A heat map of stations where short trips ended. 

#### Dashboard 4: What about Des Moines Iowa and Citibike prospects?

- What about Des Moines? Is there anything to be learned from McDonalds density in NYC that pertains to Citibike sharing, which can be used to help decide if Des Moines should start a similar program?
- Summary statistics comparing NYC and Des Moines population densities, McDonalds densities, and rough extrapolation of Des Moines prospects.
- Des Moines and West Des Moines McDonalds locations: a map showing the fourteen locations.

#### Conclusions.

- The McDonalds density analysis is interesting. It does show that in NYC, the McDonalds do tend to be clustered near the most popular stations, but both measures are most likely simply be a factor of population density.  Still it is interesting, that to a degree, you may project bike sharing rental program usage by density of McDonald's restaurants.
- Further exploration of data may show that folks are disproportionately renting bikes near McDonalds Brooklyn and around lunch time in New York. This might lead to breakfast specials in one place and lunch specials in another.
- The stations near McDonalds appear to have at least 2,500 drop offs. This should be explored further but the projection for Des Moines of 850 drop offs per McDonalds (1,700 / 2) is too far from the NYC number of  2,500 so that McDonalds density in Des Moines would be a very poor predictor of Citibike success in Des Moines.
